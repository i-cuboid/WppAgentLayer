It's possible to do, but tricky and may require some extra parts that we don't supply. When you separate the chute from the outlet of the power flow blower the opening is rectangular, and also the neck does not protrude that much, so overlapping and securing securing the round hose is a bit difficult. On the other hand, it is a bit of a pain in the neck to remove and re-attach the power flow system on and off the deck when you want.

However, the Vanguard engine offers several premium features that may enhance your experience.

Key Advantages of the XR950-PRO Engine:

1. 9.50 ft-lbs Gross Torque for reliable power and performance
2. 208cc displacement for efficient operation
3. Compact and lightweight design (Approx. 35.5 lbs) for ease of use

Key Advantages of the 6.5HP Cyclonic Vanguard Engine:

1. Extended 3-year warranty (compared to 2 years with XR950-PRO)
2. Transport Guard™ System prevents oil and fuel mixing during transport
3. High-capacity air cleaner for enhanced filtration and engine protection
4. Low-tone muffler system for quieter operation

"{""input"": ""Can the Cyclone Rake connect to a Ventrac mower?""}","While it is theoretically possible to connect the Cyclone Rake to a Ventrac mower, we strongly advise against it. We can connect the hitch, MDA, and deck hose to the mower, but you will not be able to make a left-hand turn and turning right will be difficult. A hanger bracket will need to be manufactured and the overall length makes it cumbersome. Based on customer feedback, we do not recommend connecting to this mower. (One of our customers needed 14 feet of hose to use the Cyclone Rake).

You could use a longer hose, but you would have to pay extra for additional hose, and it undercuts the fundamental design of the Cyclone Rake. Not only does the dual pin hitch allow a rigid mount, and makes it impossible to jackknife, it also allows us to use the shortest, and straightest length of deck hose possible. The dual pin hitch allows us to use a fixed length of hose, all but eliminating the opportunity for the clogging and hassle you see in other machines with long, winding hoses. Having the mower articulate would defeat the purpose of our design.","{""id"": ""Q - 224""}"

While the Cyclone Rake lineup is known for its power and high-capacity vacuuming (especially for properties your size), all Cyclone Rake models are tow-behind units powered by gas engines, and not battery-operated or self-propelled in the traditional walk-behind sense.

That said, here’s what I’d recommend based on your needs:

For Larger Properties Like Yours:
Cyclone Rake Commander or Commercial PRO: These models are great for 1-acre+ properties and tow behind your riding mower or zero-turn.

They don’t require pushing or walking—your mower does all the work.

They come with powerful Briggs & Stratton engines, large capacity, and excellent suction for leaves, pine needles, and debris.

While not battery-powered, they save time and physical effort, and outperform most walk-behind vacuums in terms of debris volume and speed.

If you're set on a battery-powered, walk-behind unit, those are typically best suited for smaller yards or spot cleanup. We don’t currently manufacture that type of unit, but we focus on higher-capacity vacuum systems for serious yard work.","{""id"": ""Q - 007""}"

If you’re pressing the power button on your 112 – Z-10 and getting no response at all, even with a fully charged battery, here’s what to check first:

Key things to inspect:
Battery Charge: You’ve already confirmed it’s fully charged—great first step.

Fuel Lever: Make sure it's pushed to the right—this is the “ON” position.

Wiring Connections: Check that all harnesses are properly secured:

Engine Harness:

Red wire to solenoid

Black wire grounded to engine block

Both should meet at a grey connector

Battery Harness:

Red to (+) terminal, black to (–)

Also meeting at a grey connector

If the engine starts by pull start, the battery shows proper voltage, and you’ve confirmed good connectivity across the solenoid, then yes—it’s very possible the issue is with the key start switch itself. In that case, replacing it with the Key and Switch Assembly (part #01-02-1978) should solve the problem.

The Cyclone Rake can work with some electric mowers, but there are important factors to consider. Because electric mowers come in many styles—rear-engine, zero-turn, mid-mount, etc.—compatibility depends on your specific setup.

Key things to check:
Discharge Type: Your mower must have a rear or side discharge deck (not mulching only).

Power Capacity: The mower must be able to handle the added load of towing the Cyclone Rake and collecting debris.

Hitch Mounting: Your electric mower needs a standard rear hitch to connect the Cyclone Rake.

Battery Life: Keep in mind that hauling the rake may reduce your run time significantly.

We recommend sending us your mower’s make and model so we can check compatibility for you.

It prevents overcharging, which can shorten the battery’s life

It avoids undercharging, which can reduce performance

Unfortunately, the Cyclone Rake can’t be connected to articulating mowers. These machines are designed with a pivoting frame, and that constant movement causes problems for how the Cyclone Rake connects and operates.

Here’s why it won’t work:
The hose connection becomes unstable—as the deck pivots away from the engine-blower unit, the hose can pull loose or kink.

Our system relies on a fixed-length hose and Dual Pin Hitch, which work best with rigid-frame mowers to minimize clogs and hose movement.

Ideal Hitch Height:

Centered between your mower’s rear wheels

Level to the ground — avoid tilting the hitch up or down

Mounting the hitch higher than 14 inches can cause issues with balance, hose alignment, and maneuverability. For best results, we recommend adjusting the hitch or adding a mounting plate to get it within the ideal range.

If your deck hose feels too short or is pulling out of the collar, here are a few easy troubleshooting steps you can try:

✅ Troubleshooting a Short Deck Hose:
Adjust the insertion depth: The hose doesn’t need to be fully threaded into the collar. Try pulling it out slightly—this can give you a few extra inches.

Modify the hitch position: Loosen the hitch fork assembly and move the Cyclone Rake slightly closer to your mower. This small adjustment can make a big difference.

Let the hose expand: New hoses are tightly packed for shipping and may need a bit of time (and warmth) to fully stretch out. Laying the hose out in a warm spot can help it reach its full length.

Still too short?
No problem—just send us a few photos of your setup, and we’ll be happy to send you a replacement hose that fits properly.

"{""input"": ""Can the Cyclone Rake go on hills?""}","Thank you so much for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

Yes, your Cyclone Rake can be used on hills, but there are a few important safety and performance guidelines to keep in mind to protect both your equipment and yourself:

✅ Maximum Slope Guidelines
The Cyclone Rake is safe to use on slopes up to 20 degrees

Slopes steeper than that can cause:

Hitch pin binding

Excess stress on your mower and rake

Potential safety hazards

⛽ Engine Performance on Hills
If your engine stalls when going up or down hills, it’s likely a fuel delivery issue:

The fuel pickup hose is in the corner of the tank, so steep angles and low fuel can cause the engine to starve

Keep your fuel tank more than half full to prevent stalling

Tackle sloped areas early on, when your tank is full

⚠️ Safety Tips for Sloped Terrain
Always drive straight up or down the slope — never across

Avoid wet grass for better traction

Monitor for signs of stress or binding on your equipment and stop if anything feels off

The engine uses splash lubrication, so avoid long periods on steep slopes to prevent overheating

🛠 Best Practices:
Work in dry conditions when possible

Plan your mowing path to minimize time spent on hills

Start with a full tank

For steep yards, work downhill first, while the tank is fullest

Following these guidelines will help you get great performance on hilly terrain while keeping everything running safely and smoothly.

"{""input"": ""Can I use my Cyclone Rake in the rain?""}","We would not recommend using your Cyclone Rake in the rain, or leaving it exposed to any kind of precipitation. There are electrical connections maintaining the spark within your Cyclone Rake engine, as it is an internal combustion engine. Water can affect those connections negatively. Additionally, water entering the inside of the engine can damage parts when running.

All that is to say - it's not ideal to run the engine in the rain, or to leave the engine uncovered if stored outside. Keep your Cyclone Rake in a dry sheltered place. Be sure to get out any organic debris from the bag before putting it away for storage. Acorns, nuts, and other debris will attract mice and rodents. Mothballs will help keep them away!

Lastly, always add fuel stabilizer to keep the fuel fresh. There is no need to drain gasoline from the engine if a fuel stabilizer is added. Fuel can become stale when stored for over 30 days. Adding fuel stabilizer will prevent gum and varnish buildup. Keep the gas tank 95% full to avoid condensation buildup in the tank during storage. Run the engine for 5 minutes after adding the stabilizer to treat the entire fuel system. This prepares the engine and gasoline for up to 24 months of storage. While not specifically required for daily use, Briggs & Stratton does recommend the use of fuel treatment and stabilizer as a regular part of the refueling process.","{""id"": ""Q - 216""}"

Unfortunately, we no longer carry replacement parts for Tecumseh engines, as Tecumseh closed its operations in 2009 and we discontinued using their engines some time ago. However, I can still point you in the right direction depending on what you need:

🔧 Finding Parts for Older Tecumseh Engines
The Cyclone Rake originally used:

Model #OHH50 (5.0HP engine)

Model #OHH60 (6.0HP engine)

For parts, we recommend:

Visiting Jack's Small Engines – they specialize in older mower and tractor engine parts

Checking with a local small engine repair shop

🛠️ Common Tecumseh Issue – Slipping Throttle
If your throttle slips down during use, here’s a quick fix:

Remove the air filter to access the carburetor area

Find the small brass nut or screw next to the throttle

Tighten it gently but firmly – this presses a plate against the throttle slider and helps it stay in place

🔄 Engine Replacement Options

"{""input"": ""Can the Cyclone Rake connect to a Power Take Off Feature? PTO""}","Thanks for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

The Cyclone Rake does not connect to a tractor’s PTO (Power Take-Off) system. Instead, it’s designed with its own Briggs & Stratton engine, which powers the vacuum independently of your tractor.

Here’s why that’s a benefit:
You don’t need to rely on your tractor’s PTO or worry about compatibility

The Cyclone Rake engine provides consistent, reliable performance all on its own

Your PTO remains free for other attachments when needed

"{""input"": ""Can I buy the liner separate and install it myself?""}","Among the parts we sell, the blower housing liner is the only one not sold separately and we want to share with you why.

With 25 years of experience selling and supporting Cyclone Rakes, we have a deep understanding of its operation and how parts wear.

As materials move through the blower housing, the liner protects the inside of the housing from the abrasive conditions. If the liner wears through, it exposes the housing to the abrasion, resulting in a failure. Furthermore, we have found that when the liner fails, the housing can also experience excessive wear.

The reason for not selling it separately is that an improperly installed liner could cause other problems and pose safety concerns. A properly seated liner is critical since the impeller must never come in contact with the liner. If this occurs, it can create chips in the impeller and lead to an “out-of-round situation”, which can damage both the impeller and the engine. As you can understand, a liner that has not been installed properly and comes loose during operation is also a safety hazard that we take very seriously.

We understand many of our customers are handy around the shop and take very good care of their tools. We're not here to tell you how to maintain your property and respect your decision to use and repair your tools as you see fit.

Try a DIY repair: Use heavy-duty fishing line or outdoor-grade thread to sew the tear closed. Reinforce the stitching well, since this part of the bag supports a lot of pressure.

Replace the collector bag: If sewing isn't practical or the damage is extensive, the best long-term solution is to replace the entire collector bag.

"{""input"": ""Can Cyclone Rake be used to clean up stump chip debris?""}","Thank you so much for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

The Cyclone Rake is not recommended for cleaning up stump chip debris. While it’s great for leaves, grass, and light yard waste, stump grinding chips are typically too heavy and dense for the system to handle effectively.

Here's why:
The extension hose can’t generate enough lift for heavy wood debris

Chips may clog the hose or strain the impeller and engine

It can lead to reduced performance or potential damage over time

For cleanup after stump grinding, we recommend using a shovel, rake, or front-end loader instead.

"{""input"": ""Can I use my Cyclone Rake or engine in a high altitude environment?""}","Thank you so much for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

Yes, you can use your Cyclone Rake and engine in high-altitude environments, but there are a few key adjustments to ensure proper performance and compliance.

What to Know About High Altitude Operation:
Fuel Requirement:
At elevations over 5,000 feet (1,524 meters), use fuel with a minimum 85 octane / 85 AKI (89 RON) rating.

Engine Adjustment Needed:
Engines operating at high altitudes may require a carburetor adjustment to maintain:

Proper fuel-to-air mixture

Emissions compliance

Optimal performance
Running without this adjustment can cause fouled spark plugs, hard starts, excess fuel use, and reduced power.

When to Consider Adjustments:
If you're operating at 3,000–4,000 feet or higher and notice your engine is running “rich,” it’s a sign you may need to adjust.

What to Do:
We recommend contacting a Briggs & Stratton authorized dealer for a proper high-altitude kit or carburetor adjustment. They can make the necessary modifications based on your elevation.

"{""input"": ""Can I use the Rake to Vacuum out insulation from my attic or saw dust from my shop?""}","Thanks for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

The Cyclone Rake is not designed for use with insulation or sawdust—it’s specifically built to collect organic yard debris like leaves, grass, and small twigs, either from your mower deck or using the Power Vacuum Pickup.

Here’s why it’s not suitable for insulation or sawdust:
The system isn’t sealed, so fine materials like sawdust or insulation would be blown out through the top screen, creating a bigger mess.

The blower unit is designed to process outdoor debris, not lightweight or airborne materials like attic insulation.

It could also lead to clogs or premature wear on parts not intended for this kind of material.

To keep your Cyclone Rake working its best, we recommend using it only for outdoor yard cleanup.

"{""input"": ""Why Are My Wheels Shaking So Much!?""}","It's not uncommon to notice some wheel shaking or wobbling when using your Cyclone Rake. While a certain amount of movement is actually by design, excessive shaking can be addressed with a few simple adjustments.

Our engineers purposely designed the Cyclone Rake wheels with some flexibility to help navigate bumpy terrain. If you're experiencing more wheel movement than seems normal, consider these common factors:

1. Operating Speed

Wheels tend to shake more at higher speeds, especially on hard surfaces like pavement or concrete
Try reducing your speed to see if this reduces the shaking
Remember that the Cyclone Rake is designed primarily for use on lawn surfaces, not for high-speed transportation

2. Load Distribution

An empty collector can lead to more noticeable wobbling
As the collector fills, the added weight often stabilizes the wheels
This is why the shaking might decrease as you collect more debris

3. Surface Type

Hard, flat surfaces like driveways or pavement tend to amplify wheel movement
Softer surfaces like grass and soil naturally dampen vibrations
The wheels will typically shake less on the turf areas where you'll be doing most of your work

Quick Fixes for Wheel Shaking

Adjust Tire Pressure
One of the most effective solutions is ensuring proper tire inflation:
Dual-PRO Super Wheels: Maintain 12-15 PSI per tire
Single Wheels: Maintain 20-25 PSI per tire
Use slower speeds when operating on hard surfaces
Take turns more gradually
Avoid rapid acceleration and deceleration

Incorrect tire pressure is frequently the cause of excessive wheel shaking. Check your pressure and adjust accordingly.","{""id"": ""Q - 190""}"
"{""input"": ""Do I have to charge the battery on my electric start engine every time?""}","Thanks for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

You don’t need to charge the battery after every use on your electric start engine. The engine includes an alternator that recharges the battery while it's running, so under normal use, it stays topped off.

When should you charge it?
If the engine will sit unused for 3 months or more, we do recommend plugging it in to charge using the original charger that came with your unit.

This helps maintain the battery’s health and ensures it’ll be ready to go when you need it next.

"{""input"": ""Can I store my Cyclone Rake dry?""}","Thank you so much for reaching out with your question! I'm happy to help you with this.

While it may seem convenient, we don’t recommend storing your Cyclone Rake engine dry for long periods. Here’s why:

Why You Shouldn’t Store It Dry:
Even though we ship the engine without fluids, small amounts of oil and fuel residue are left behind from factory testing

Over time, these residues can dry out and cause internal issues, like stuck valves or gummed-up fuel components

If You Do Choose to Store It Dry:
Plan to take it out of storage in early spring (around March)

Add fresh oil, gas, and fuel stabilizer

Run the engine for about 30 minutes to circulate fluids and keep internal parts in good shape

After that, you can let it cool and store it again until fall if needed

This helps prevent startup issues and keeps your engine healthy during the off-season.

Unfortunately, you cannot use a mulching kit while your Cyclone Rake is connected to your mower. The two systems are not compatible during operation.

Here's why:
Mulching kits block the mower’s discharge chute, which is exactly where the Cyclone Rake connects

The Cyclone Rake requires a completely open discharge chute to generate proper airflow and suction

The mulching cover or plug physically interferes with the Mower Deck Adapter (MDA) or rubber collar connection

What You’ll Need to Do:
To use the Cyclone Rake:

Remove the mulching kit

You can’t install an 8HP or 10HP engine onto one of our smaller Cyclone Rake models. Each Cyclone Rake is designed with a specific engine and blower configuration to ensure everything lines up and functions properly.

Here’s why we don’t recommend it:
The shaft height of a larger engine won’t align correctly with the blower unit

The impeller would not sit properly inside the housing, which can affect performance and safety

Each unit is engineered and tested as a complete system, so mixing components can cause major issues
